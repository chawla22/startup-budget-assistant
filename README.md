# startup-budget-assistant

In this challenge, you'll build a simple budgeting assistant using JavaScript. This assistant will track your startup's initial capital, monthly revenue, and expenses, then calculate key financial indicators like monthly cash flow, current balance, and profitability status.
This is your introduction to using expressions, variables, and primitive data types to represent financial and status information in a basic business context.
